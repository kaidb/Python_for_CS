    "    - For example: mapping server names to IP addresses\n",

    "## Initializing a Socket\n",
    "- The most common way of initializing a socket in python is to call the socket constructor as follows: \n",
    "    - `sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`\n",
    "    - Note the variable name you assign it to doesn't matter, but by convention and for readability, a selection is typically made from $\\{\\text{s,sock} \\}$\n",
    "## Breaking down the Command\n",
    "- The INET sockets, account for the vast majority of sockets in use. \n",
    "    - `AF_INET` corresponds to network protocol IPv4. For IPv6 use `AF_INET6 `\n",
    "- Stream sockets/connection-oriented sockets send and receive data over Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n",
    "    - Technically speaking, they could also send/receive data using SCTP and also DCCP. We will only worry about TCP "
